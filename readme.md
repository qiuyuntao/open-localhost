open-localhost
---

This is a line tool to open anything you like with  *chrome*.

#### how to use

* If you want to open `localhost:8001`, then you can use command `o --p 8001`
* As I'm a Mac user, so I set apache always start. The root directory is `/Users/username`, and port is `8080`.
  * So if I want to open a file, and the file's directory is `/Users/username/demo/css/index.js`. You can use command like this.
    ```
    cd
    o /demo/css/index.js

    or

    cd /demo/css
    o index.js
    ```
  * It can also open a directory, not only file. Use command `o /demo`
